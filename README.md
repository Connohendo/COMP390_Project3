# COMP390_Project3


This project was originally sourced by Professor J. Matta at Bridgewater State University. He tasked us with cleaning
the project by implementing best practices used within the industry. 

The project takes a message and allows the user to encrypt and decrypt the message as they please. Among this the have 
other commands to help clear the file system and etc.

To get started please run the project by entering the project directory and typing python jlock.py -h

This will get you through to the help section of the project where you can read all about the commands available to you.

Another example commands would be python jlock.py -clear

Thanks and again credit goes to Professor J. Matta!
